# Style-Preserving Generator to Make Synthetic License Plate Data
![SPG.jpg](SPG.jpg)
> **Abstract:** We propose the Style-Preserving Generator (SPG) to make synthetic license plate data and address the data imbalance and privacy issues when making a License Plate Recognition (LPR) model. The proposed SPG can edit the characters on real-world license plates while maintaining their original styles, enabling the generation of synthetic license plate data with user-specified characters. We can thus synthesize license plates with desired characters to effectively alleviate the data imbalance and privacy issues associated with real-world license plates. The SPG consists of several components: a transformer, a source encoder, a source style encoder, a character mask decoder, a target generator, and a target discriminator. Given a source license plate image and a specified text as inputs, these components are working together to compute the self- and cross-attention embeddings, predict character masks, and generate a synthetic license plate in the source style but with source characters replaced by the specified characters. We adopt a two-phase training scheme. Phase 1 involves using synthetic training data with ground-truth character masks available, followed by Phase 2 hybrid training using both synthetic and real-life data without the ground-truth character masks of the latter. To showcase the effectiveness of the SPG, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, namely the LP-2024 (License Plate 2024), which alleviates the limitations of existing datasets and presents new challenges for license plate recognition and generative models. We validate the SPGâ€™s performance on the LP-2024 dataset and other benchmark datasets, and compare it against state-of-the-art text editing approaches.
